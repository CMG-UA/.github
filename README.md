# CMG-UA Github manual

This is the github page of the Center of Medical Genetics (CMG) from UZA and University of Antwerp. If you are new here and want to collaborate on some projects take a look at these best practises and how our flow is.

more information about the CMG can be found on the [website of CMG](https://www.genetica-antwerpen.be/en/)

## Best Practices

All the code of CMG needs to be placed on Github and not only on the server.

**GITHUB IS NOT A DATA-STORAGE! Nothing larger than 50MB should be commited here.**

- Always try to keep it documented
- 
## How to use Github

A nice cheatsheet to refer to is the following one [Github education cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

### Some commands that you will need:

To make a branch where you can make changes on the code without changing the original:
`$ git checkout -b <branch_name>`

To add the changes you have made to github: `$ git add <your_changes>`

To commit the changes after you have added them and give some usefull information about the changes:
`$ git commit -m "<usefull message about what the commit is>"`

To put the changes on the Github page: `$ git push`

When you are done with your branch and you want these to be with the main branch, you need to make a **pull request** on the Github page of CMG. 

**NEVER PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH!**

### If you have an issue

You can make an issue on the github page by the branch you have to issue on. Try always to be so complete as possible so that the person who is solving the issue has all the necessary information. 

This is also important for helping people that maybe have the same issue after you.
